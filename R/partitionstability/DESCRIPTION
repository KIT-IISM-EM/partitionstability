Description: Exemplary implementations of Algorithms 1 to 4 of Ball, F and Geyer-Schulz A
    (2018) <doi:TBA> that can be used to test partition stability given a set of 
    generators for a permutation group that acts on the partitioned set.
    The implementations strongly relate to the pseudocode, which means there certainly 
    exist ways to implement the algorithms more efficiently.
    However, the main focus lies on supplying supplemental material for the cited article.
