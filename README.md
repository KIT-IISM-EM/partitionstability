# partitionstability
Implementations of algorithms to test (graph clustering) partition stability

The provided code implements the algorithms, which are given in pseudocode, 
presented by <a href="#ref" id="text">Ball and Geyer-Schulz (2018)</a>.
At the moment we provide code written in Python and R.

You are free to use the provided code in your own work but if you do, 
we encourage you to cite the reference below.

## Documentation
There is a documentation for the Python implementation available under 
https://KIT-IISM-EM.github.io/partitionstability/html/.
The documentation for the R code can be found under in the directory [R/partitionstability.pdf](./R/partitionstability.pdf)
