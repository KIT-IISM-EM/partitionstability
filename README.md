# partitionstability
Implementations of algorithms to test (graph clustering) partition stability

The provided code implements the algorithms, which are given in pseudocode, 
presented by Ball and Geyer-Schulz (2018)[^1].

You are free to use the provided code in your own work but if you do, 
we encourage you to cite the reference below.

## Documentation
